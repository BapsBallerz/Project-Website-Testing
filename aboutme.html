        <h3>Veer Patel</h3>

        <p>My name is Veer Patel and I am from Dothan Alabama. I didn't get into coding until the beginning of 2022. Ever since then I have always wanted to become a Computer Engineer. I love coding and it makes me more creative of what I am doing. I always thought coding was to difficult and there is no way I would be able to do it, but since I got a great teacher name Mitali she has guided me and she has helped me so much. I have learned so much in 51 classes and there is even more to learn. Whoever read this, please give a try at coding. It will be the best thing you have done and you will fall in love with it. Thank you for reading. BYE!!!!üòÅ </p>
